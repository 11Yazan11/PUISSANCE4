ADD TIME TO PLAY LIKE IN CHESS.

MAKE A FOLDER TO SAVE USERNAME, PLAYER INFO, .... : ONCE THE PLAYER GOES MP ONCE, THESE INFOS ARE SAVED IN THE SERVER, AND MUST ALWAYS BEEN SYNCED.



DESCRIPTION:


Here’s the plan:

First-time connection: When only a name is provided (without an ID), it's a new player. The server should:
1. Generate a new unique ID for the player.
2. Save the player with default values (0 for money, globalscore, and an empty list for skins).
3. Respond with the generated ID and their saved name.


Returning player: If both ID and name are provided, the server should:
1. Check if the ID exists in the database.
2. If the ID exists, return the player’s data (name, money, score, skins).
3. If the ID doesn’t exist, handle it as an error or create a new player if needed.



-A PLAYER LAUNCHING THE GAME FOR THE FIRST TIME = CONNECTS TO THE SERVER FOR THE FIRST TIME:

GET: their ID from the server (saved definitively into appdata)
PROVIDE: their definitive name 

* The state of their money, score, and skins is at 0 if it is the first time.


-A PLAYER LAUNCHING THE GAME ANOTHER TIME = CONNECTS TO THE SERVER:

CAN QUERY TO KNOW AT ANY TIME: all their progress (money, score, skins) AND THEIR NAME WHICH IS SAVED IN THE SERVER AND CANNOT BE CHANGED.

-WHEN A PURCHASE (money and skins) IS DONE:
    The client requests it to the server which updates the MongoDB directly.

-WHEN A WIN (score) HAPPENS IN A LOBBY:
    The server updates both players' info in the MongoDB and sends for each client its new player data.
